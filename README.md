# Impact of Voice on Disclosure

## Overview

The **Impact of Voice on Disclosure** project aims to study the extent to which people are influenced in their discussions by the voice of their interviewer. This project involves generating different voices and using them in conversations during fake job interviews, facilitated by RASA, an open-source conversational AI platform.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
1. To explore the psychological and behavioral effects of different interviewer voices on participants during interviews.
2. To analyze how variations in voice characteristics (e.g., tone, pitch, speed) influence the level of disclosure and comfort of interviewees.
3. To provide insights into the design of AI interviewers and the potential impact on user interactions.

## Methodology

### Voice Generation

- Various voices were generated using text-to-speech (TTS) technologies.
- Different voice characteristics were manipulated to create distinct interviewer personas.

### Conversation Simulation

- Fake job interviews were conducted using RASA, an open-source conversational AI platform.
- Interview scenarios were scripted to ensure consistency across different voice conditions.

### Data Collection

- Participant responses and interactions were recorded and transcribed using speech-to-text technologies.
- Data on participant comfort levels, openness, and willingness to disclose information were collected through post-interview surveys.

### Analysis

- Qualitative and quantitative analysis was performed on the collected data.
- Statistical methods were used to determine the impact of different voices on participant behavior.
